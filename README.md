# Connect4

## I am writing this in AngularJS instead of Angular so I can have the ability to work on this at school, since terminal is blocked there.

This is basically just a regular Connect4 game, where users can create profiles and keep a rating. There is also an embeded mode, so other people can just add this to their website for games and things.

## Game Ideas:
Users can have a specific colour counter when they join, and they can change it (maybe every week or something).
There can be more than 2 people, for example you can have 4 people playing on a bigger board.

## Hosting
Using firebase to host, use this to deploy:
```
firebase deploy
```

## Embeded:
Use this URL to access the embed mode: https://connect4-863d1.web.app/game.html?embed=true
